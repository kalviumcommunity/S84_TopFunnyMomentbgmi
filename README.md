Clip filtering based on categories such as "Fails," "Lucky Kills," "Weird Bugs," and "Troll Moments."
Comment Section: Users can comment, respond, and meme to uploaded clips.
User Profiles: Registered users can view their uploaded clips and voting history.
Shareability: Feature to share clips directly to social media (WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, etc.).
